The never ending story
The story of two sides
The story of the city ones
And those who lived in farm

Them city ones to never know
The happiness
And joy
Of the red morning sun
And freshly baked pie
In a tegridy farm

So, thee who didn't lived here
Can not appreciate
The smell and color of the poops
That our cows to make
		to make...
			to make...
